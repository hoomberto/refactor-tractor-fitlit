## Overview and Project Goals
FitLit is an application built in week 10 of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).  The goal of this group [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/refactor-tractor.html) was to refactor an existing codebase to build a responsive fitness tracking application.

### Learning Goals

- Building on top of a pre-existing codebase
- Implementing SCSS to DRY up repetitive styling

- Making network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Utilizing third party packages
- Creating an enjoyable user experience and responsive user interface
