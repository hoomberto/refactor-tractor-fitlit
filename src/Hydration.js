// Create classes and methods that can calculate:
//
//  For a user (identified by their userID - this is the same for all methods requiring a specific user’s data), the average fluid ounces consumed per day for all time
//  For a user, how many fluid ounces they consumed for a specific day (identified by a date)
//  For a user, how many fluid ounces of water consumed each day over the course of a week (7 days) - return the amount for each day
// You have to decide which classes should contain each method. Think about whose responsibility it is to own the method.
